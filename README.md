* This is **CourseBook**, a desktop application for **students** who want to easily identify and contact friends from particular modules to resolve problems such as questions about assignments.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Find classmates taking the same module to ask questions
  * Organize study groups with friends from specific courses
  * Get help with assignments from peers in the same class
* CourseBook helps students manage their academic network by organizing contacts based on the modules they are taking together.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion** and provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* CourseBook is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[CourseBook Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f10-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
