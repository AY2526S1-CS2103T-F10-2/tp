* This is **a project done by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * to find the contacts of friends taking the same course as you
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `CourseBook` because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects.
* For the detailed documentation of this `AddressBook` project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
